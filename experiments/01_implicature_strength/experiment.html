        During this experiment you will alternate back and forth between two tasks:
        <br>
        Half of the time you will be prompted with an arithmetic equation. <strong>Your task is to find and provide the answer to the provided equation to the best of your ability. You will be paid even if you make math mistakes and you may use a pen and paper to help. However, please DO NOT use a calculator. </strong>
        <br>
        The other half of the time you will be prompted with a sentence that has been cut short. For example "The student was absent from school because she _____ ." <strong> Your task is to fill in the blank to complete the provided sentence.</strong>
        <br>
        The experiment will take approximately 30 minutes.

        Great! Now we can start the real experiment. You will now read 20 sentences. Your task is to rate how similar the red sentence is to the blue sentence where the word 'some' is replaced with 'some, but not all'. Sometimes, the blue sentence will sound strange. In this case, give a rating to the best of your ability, but also click the checkbox next to "The blue sentence sounds strange".
